* Vanilla Lambda Calculus
** About
A plain implementation of lambda calculus, nothing special (it is
vanilla).  This was created in order to implement Conway's Game of
Life, read about it [[file:example/README.org][here]].

** Technical details
The code is functional, terms can share references in memory, but are
reduced separately. To get improved speeds two values are attached to
each term: dirty and depth.  Dirty is true if there exists the
possibility of reductions inside the term.  Depth is the value of the
outer-most variable used inside the term.  A clean term is not reduced
and depth can determine if substitutions are necessary.
